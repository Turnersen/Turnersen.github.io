So it‚Äôs a relief when his skill on the basketball court earns him a scholarship to college, far away from his childhood home. He soon meets Julia Padavano, a spirited and ambitious young woman who surprises William with her appreciation of his quiet steadiness. With Julia comes her family; she is inseparable from her three younger sisters: Sylvie, the dreamer, is happiest with her nose in a book and imagines a future different from the expected path of wife and mother; Cecelia, the family‚Äôs artist; and Emeline, who patiently takes care of all of them. Happily, the Padavanos fold Julia‚Äôs new boyfriend into their loving, chaotic household.</p>
